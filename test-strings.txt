SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
Nos. 14-556. Argued April 28, 2015 - Decided June 26, 2015
Together with No. 14-562, Tanco et al. v. Haslam, Governor of 
Tennessee, et al., also on centiorari to the same court.
Opinion of the Court
As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage
embodies a love that may endure even past death.
It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect
the idea of marriage.
Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that 
they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves.
Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, 
excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions.
They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law.
The Constitution grants them that right.
The judgement of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.
It is so ordered.
KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which 
GINSBURG, BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., joined.
